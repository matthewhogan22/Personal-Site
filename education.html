        <p class="section-para">I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with concentrations in Digital
            Media and Machine Intelligence, and an expected graduation date of December 2026. My academic focus blends strong theoretical foundations with creative and
            applied computing, allowing me to approach problems from both analytical and user-centered perspectives. Through my studies, I have developed a solid grounding
            in systems, algorithms, and software design while continuously applying these concepts to real-world projects and professional experiences. </p>

        <section class="section-title" id="courses">Relevant Coursework</section>
        <p class="section-para">My coursework has provided a rigorous foundation in both the theory and practice of computer science. Classes such as Data Structures and
            Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics have strengthened my problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning skills, while
            Object-Oriented Programming, Objects and Design, and Computer Organization and Programming have emphasized clean software architecture and low-level system
            understanding. Together, these courses have prepared me to design efficient, scalable solutions and to reason carefully about performance, correctness, and
            maintainability</p>

        <section class="section-title" id="campus-inv">Campus Involvement</section>
        <p class="section-para">Beyond the classroom, I am actively involved in campus organizations that emphasize leadership, collaboration, and community building.
            I am a founder and former alumni liaison for Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity, where I help guide organizational growth and maintain strong alumni connections.
            Additionally, I serve on the executive board of Georgia Tech Club Golf, contributing to team coordination and operations. These roles have strengthened my
            leadership, communication, and organizational skills while allowing me to engage meaningfully with the Georgia Tech community.</p></div>
