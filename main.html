            My name is Matthew Hogan. I am from Mableton, GA, born to an American father and Costa Rican Mother, and the oldest of 4 children.
            I am currently a student studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Outside of school, I am an avid (though honestly not as good as
            I should be) golfer and I also enjoy going to concerts and playing video games with friends. My passions in coding are primarily in Computer Audio (especially related to music),
            Data Science and Analysis, and bringing my code to life in creating Embedded Systems.
            <br> <br> <br>
            I got my start in coding by joining my high school robotics club. I began working in an old shed with older machinery coding remote operated drones (if you can even call
            them that) in Basic and sending them out on expeditions around campus to see how far we could get them while still receiving a video signal. That ignited a spark in me that led me to
            continue to pursue this passion by joining the competitive FIRST Robotics team. This was even more of a rush for me as I was working with much newer technology, but also in a competitive
            environment where I could actually see the fruits of my labor coming to life as our bot navigated autonomously around the arena. I pursued this through all 4 years of high school,
            reaching the state championship 3 years in a row and finishing runner-up in state my final 2 years. Looking to pursue that passion professionally, I enrolled in Georgia Tech and began my
            degree in Computer Science. Throughout my time here, I have been able to continue to develop my passion for coding in new and exciting areas, ranging from computer audio to machine
            learning. All of these areas have truly fascinated me and allowed me to continue to strive toward excellence in the high paced, competitive environment that is Georgia Tech.
