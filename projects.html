            Developed a bot for Discord that allows users to listen to songs together in a voice channel. It utilizes the yt.dlp, and discord
             bot libraries to locate, queue, and play the songs. No additional software needed for users (other than giving
            the bot permissions to join their respective server/voice channel. Has multifaceted interaction with users, allowing them to queue/play songs by typing "-play {song title}". This will
            either play that song (if nothing is currently playing) or add that song to the queue (if there is currently a song playing). Command buttons are also included to allow the user to
            skip a track, pause/resume playback, stop the bot altogether (disconnect and wipe the queue), view the current song queue, and shuffle the current song queue. The bot responds to
            commands to let the user know their chosen song has been queued as well as includes a hyperlink to the YouTube video that it is pulling the audio from. Users can also queue playlists
            by linking the spotify playlist, and the bot takes those songs and queues them in their respective order.
