                Developed a bot for Discord that allows users to listen to songs together in a voice channel. It utilizes the yt.dlp, and discord
                bot libraries to locate, queue, and play the songs. No additional software needed for users (other than giving
                the bot permissions to join their respective server/voice channel. Has multifaceted interaction with users, allowing them to queue/play songs by typing "-play {song title}". This will
                either play that song (if nothing is currently playing) or add that song to the queue (if there is currently a song playing). Command buttons are also included to allow the user to
                skip a track, pause/resume playback, stop the bot altogether (disconnect and wipe the queue), view the current song queue, and shuffle the current song queue. The bot responds to
                commands to let the user know their chosen song has been queued as well as includes a hyperlink to the YouTube video that it is pulling the audio from. Users can also queue playlists
                by linking the spotify playlist, and the bot takes those songs and queues them in their respective order.

            <p class="section-para">Developed a companion app in android studio, allowing users to access their yearly "Spotify Wrapped" summary at any point throughout the year. Users can link
            their actual Spotify account and, using the Spotify API, we can deliver their summary on their top artists, songs, albums, and more. We also incorporated use of Google Firebase
            so that users can access their information from any device with persistent storage, even allowing them to view previous "Wrappeds" to see how their music tastes have progressed.
            Lastly, we incorporated the use of Chat-GPT's API to allow users to both get song recommendations based on their listening patterns and even communicate with a chatbot that
            emulates their favorite artist. This bot replicates that artist's linguistics and personality to enhance the overall user experience.

                This is an Android app for keeping your schedule, designed for students primarily. It allows you to keep track of class schedules, upcoming assignments, and even your personal
                To-Do list. It allows for easy compartmentalization, giving you the option for each view, as well as the ability to edit, delete, and check items off your list. It also
                implements Google Firebase Data Storage so you can keep up with your schedules and tasks across devices.

                (Reference at this link: https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-worlds-hardest-game). This game has the user navigate the screen with the arrow keys controlling the player icon
            , attempting to avoid the moving red squares (in consistent vertical or horizontal patterns). The game ends when the user either touches a red square, reaches the green square,
            or the timer reaches 0. This game was coded entirely in C with the idea that it can be uploaded to a Gameboy Advanced Game System and allow the user to play on that.

                This is a project to design and implement an audio notification interface. The purpose of this interface is to be intuitive to the user's surroundings and the contexts under
                which they can devote their attention to different notifications. This system has 4 scenarios: working out, walking through the city, sitting in a coffee shop with friends,
                and presenting in front of a class. Based on the situation, the interface decides how much information to deliver (notification sound, message sender, message content, etc.)
                and makes the appropriate adjustment to the audio flow. The interface makes use of recorded as well as synthesized audio for notification sounds as well as text to speech for
                reading message sender and/or content. It also provides background audio relevant to the appropriate scenario and ducks the audio when delivering notifications relevant to how
                much external audio the user needs to perceive.
